This is my university project- PyMOT. It's intended to be a superior version of the government web tool for MOT checks. 
The graphical design is quite crude since I'm focusing on other features at the moment, however it's fully functional.

To try it, run "apigui.exe" in the PyMOT folder. When it asks for an API key, click Browse and select "mot_api.txt" in this folder.

After clicking OK, you can enter a car's registration, click Submit and view anything about it easily.
By clicking on a date in the left-hand box, you can view a specific MOT and see all faults and advisories.
